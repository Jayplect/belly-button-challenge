## Overview
The belly button is a peculiar habitat that houses a lot of microbes yet it remains unexplored. The Public Science lab in January 2011, undertook a research to investigate the Biodiversity of microbes in the human navel as well as the beneficial roles microbes play in our daily lives. In this project, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the  <a href ="http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/">Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks</a>, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

## Summary of Dataset
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare. The <a href = "https://github.com/Jayplect/belly-button-dashboard/tree/main/data">samples.json</a> file was not accessed locally but it is provided for reference.

## Project Steps
### Step 1: Create Horizontal bar chart 
Use the D3 library to read in samples.json from the <a href ="https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json"> URL</a>

Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

Use sample_values as the values for the bar chart.

Use otu_ids as the labels for the bar chart.

Use otu_labels as the hovertext for the chart.
