## Overview
The belly button is a peculiar habitat that houses a lot of microbes yet it remains unexplored. The Public Science lab in January 2011, undertook a research to investigate the Biodiversity of microbes in the human navel as well as the beneficial roles microbes play in our daily lives. In this project, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the  <a> href = "http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/">Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks<a/>, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

## Summary of Dataset
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare. The <a> href = "https://github.com/Jayplect/belly-button-dashboard/tree/main/data">samples.json<a/> file was not accessed locally but it is provided for reference.
